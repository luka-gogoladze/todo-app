## üöÄ Features

- **Dynamic Category Management**: Tasks are organized under four main categories: Health, Work, Mental Health, and Others.
- **Live Task Counters**: Category cards on the home screen show a real-time count of tasks, updating instantly as tasks are added or deleted.
- **Seamless Task Creation**: A clean modal allows users to quickly add new tasks and assign them to a category.
- **Instant Deletion**: Complete a task by checking the box to instantly delete it, or use the dedicated trash icon for clarity.
- **Modern & Responsive UI**: Built with Flexbox, the interface is designed to be clean, intuitive, and adaptable to various screen sizes.
- **Safe Area Aware**: The layout dynamically adjusts to device notches and status bars for a polished look on any phone.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **React Native**: Core framework for building native apps with React.
- **Expo**: Toolchain for building and deploying React Native apps with ease.
- **React**: UI library for building components.
- **React Hooks**: Used `useState` for state management within the application.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **TypeScript** (for type safety)

## üí° Potential Future Improvements

This project serves as a strong foundation. Future enhancements could include:
- **Data Persistence**: Using `AsyncStorage` to save the to-do list locally, so tasks are not lost when the app closes.
- **Animations**: Implementing `LayoutAnimation` or `react-native-reanimated` for fluid animations when adding or deleting tasks.
- **User Authentication**: Adding a login/signup system to support multiple users.
- **Cloud Sync**: Using a backend service like Firebase to sync a user's to-do list across multiple devices.
